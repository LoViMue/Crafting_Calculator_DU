This tool is designed for use in Dual Universe, but it should be compatible with other games as well, provided you can find a recipe list.

When attempting to set up our industry, we encountered a significant challenge: the sheer amount of effort required to manually calculate the data needed to determine the prices of the elements we were creating.

In my search for a solution, I came across valuable .json data containing comprehensive recipe information. This data is what powers the calculator available at https://github.com/Novean-Institute-of-Standards/du_recipies. Leveraging this resource, I developed a calculator capable of factoring in different skills.

To use the calculator, you'll need to input the percentage of cost reduction and the percentage of increased output into an Excel list. Additionally, Python with Tkinter and Pandas must be installed on your system.

While the code is written in German, I hope it remains comprehensible. This marks the first public release of the code.
